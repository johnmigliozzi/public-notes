## Ingredients

- 8 skin-on chicken thighs
- Kosher salt
- Freshly ground black pepper
- Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling
- 1 onion, chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 carrots, sliced
- 8 oz. sliced mushrooms
- 6 thyme sprigs
- 1/2 c. dry white wine
- 1 (28-oz.) can crushed tomatoes
- 3 tbsp. drained capers
- 1/4 c. freshly chopped parsley

## Directions

1. Preheat a large, cast-iron skillet over high heat. Pat chicken dry thoroughly, then season with salt and pepper. Add a drizzle of olive oil and cook chicken skin side down in two batches until skin is crisp and golden brown, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer to a dish skin side up and set aside.
2. Reduce skillet heat to medium-high. Drizzle with olive oil and add onion, garlic, carrots, mushrooms, and thyme, and cook, 3 to 4 minutes. Add white wine, and bring to a boil while scraping bottom of pan. Once at a boil, turn heat to medium low, add tomatoes and capers, and season with salt and pepper. Place chicken in the skillet skin side up in a single layer. Cover with lid and simmer for 15-20 minutes.
3. Remove lid and garnish dish with parsley, then serve in skillet immediately.
