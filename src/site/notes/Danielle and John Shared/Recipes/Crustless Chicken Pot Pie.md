## Ingredients

### Pot Pie
- 2 Tbsp. olive oil
- 2 Tbsp. butter
- 1 medium onion, _diced_
- 2 medium carrots, _diced_
- 2 celery ribs, _diced_
- 4 garlic cloves, _minced_
- 2 tsp. Italian seasoning
- 1/3 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 cups chicken broth
- 2/3 cup whole milk
- 3 cups shredded cooked chicken, _rotisserie or **[roast your own](https://www.littlebroken.com/roasted-bone-in-chicken-breast/)*
- 1/2 cup frozen peas, _do not thaw out_
- Fresh chopped parsley, _to taste_
- Kosher Salt
- Fresh black pepper

### For Serving
- Mashed Potatoes or some other starch

## Instructions
1. In a dutch oven or a large deep sauté pan, heat olive oil and butter over medium heat until the butter is melted. Add onions, carrots, and celery with a pinch of salt. Cook until tender, about 7-10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
2. Stir in garlic and Italian seasoning, and cook for about 30 seconds or until fragrant while stirring non-stop. Add flour and cook for about 1 minute, while stirring the veggies around.
3. Add chicken broth while stirring and scraping to loosen browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Add milk. Season with salt and generously with black pepper, to taste. Bring to a simmer and cook for about 3 minutes. It will thicken.
4. Stir in chicken and peas. Simmer for about 7-10 minutes until all of the vegetables are tender. Stir in parsley and serve.

## Notes
- **Chicken:** This is a great recipe to use up leftover cooked chicken too. I have a variety of chicken recipes on my site that make great leftovers, such as **[Roasted Lemon Rosemary Chicken](https://www.littlebroken.com/roasted-lemon-rosemary-chicken/)** or [**Easy Rosted Herb Chicken**](https://www.littlebroken.com/easy-roasted-herb-chicken/). I recommend dark meat for this recipe.
- **To Thin Out:** If the mixture is too thick after you add the chicken and peas, add a splash or two of chicken broth to thin out the sauce.
- **Leftovers:** Leftover chicken pot pie can be refrigerated for up to 3-4 days in an airtight container.

D: 8/10; J: 8/10
Ideally need a starch to go with it (bread, mashed potatoes, etc.)  We used dried parsley and skipped the peas.  Costco pre-shredded rotisserie chicken worked nicely.  Made 4 servings but needed more food (starch would help)

### 2022-05-08
Doubled recipe; fit in dutch oven fine
We paired with mashed potatoes (5lbs worth; we used beer pot, but probably could have use the 8qt).  Made 8 nicely-filling servings.
